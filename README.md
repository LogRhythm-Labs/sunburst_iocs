## List of IOCs from CISA STIX feed related to Alert AA20-352A

This repo contains a point-in-time download of the Indicators of Compromise provided by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in their STIX feed accompanying alert [AA20-352a](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-352a).

LogRhythm customers are encouraged to use LogRhythm Threat Intelligence Service [TIS](https://docs.logrhythm.com/docs/enterprise/other-logrhythm-applications/threat-intelligence-service-v-1-9-3) to subscribe to the CISA [feed](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA20-352A.stix.xml) rather than use these static lists. TIS will automatically create lists corresponding to the IOC types and periodically check the CISA feed for updates.

Please see the LogRhythm blog (....) for more information on leveraging LogRhythm to investigate the behavior described in this report.
